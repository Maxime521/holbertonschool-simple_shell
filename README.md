# Introduction

This simple shell project was made as part of a training to create a command interpreter that mimics the operation of a Unix shell. The shell allows you to execute commands entered by the user, manage processes and interact with the operating system.

# Description

A shell allows the user to interact with the operating system by accepting commands entered by the user from the keyboard, checking whether the user's input is correct, and executing it.

# Requirements

*General*

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to (why?)

# Compilation

To compile the shell, use the following command:

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`
